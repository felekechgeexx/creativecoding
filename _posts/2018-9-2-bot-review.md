title: Getting Your Bot Ready for the Workshop
---

On Friday, you created a [Twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/) for your bot, and you got started programming your bot in Tracery with _[Cheap Bots Done Quick](http://www.cheapbotsdonequick.com)_. There's not school on Labor day, so we'll next see each other on Wednesday, September 5. Since your complete bots are due on Friday, September 7th, class on Wednesday is dedicated to a peer review workshop of your bots.

As this is a _review_ workshop, your bot should be complete. You should be beyond the point of troubleshooting your bot and moving into revising, expanding, and improving your bot. If you still need help getting your bot set up, get that sorted out before Wednesday.

If you haven't already, you should [review the criteria your bot should meet](https://zachwhalen.github.io/creativecoding/projects/#project-bot) before it's considered complete.  If you're bot isn't doing those things, then figure out what you need to do to make it complete before class on Wednesday.

### Here's how the workshop will go:

 - Organize into groups of three
 - Spend a full 10 minutes focusing on each participant's bot
 - For each 10-minute round, the three of you will play different roles
 	- the **bot creator** should read the bot's bio and a few sample tweets -- and nothing else. DO NOT give a long introduction to your idea, just start reading
 	- the **critic** will look for problems and suggest points of improvement
 	- the **advocate** will argue on behalf of the bot, explaining its strengths and aesthetics to the critic
 - If time is left after the critic and advocate have had their turn, the creator may respond to and debrief their suggestions

On Friday, you'll each give a brief performance of your bot to the class, and we'll discuss how they all turned out.
