title: Getting started with Github, Twitter Bots, and Tracery
---

Class is underway! As you can see [from the schedule](https://zachwhalen.github.io/creativecoding/schedule/#wednesday-august-29), today's main goals will be to take a quick tour of Github and introduce the basic concepts of a tool called "Tracery" that I recommend you use for your [Bot Project](https://zachwhalen.github.io/creativecoding/projects/).

You'll have some things to look at and try for homework, but additionally, please complete another short informational survey. I'll try and embed it below, but if that doesn't work you can [try it in its own window](https://airtable.com/shrfbkBulsbZ2xH3n).

I'm mainly trying to collect information about your Github accounts so that I can find them and (with your permission) list them on our [roster page](/creativecoding/roster) so that you can easily find each other's work.

Finally, don't forget to [join our Slack](http://creativecodersatumw.slack.com/signup)! It's another way to make sure you're seeing announcements like this.
