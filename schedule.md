This page is a _tentative schedule_ of assignments and activities for the semester. 
<!-- Generally speaking, each week will follow a similar format like so:

- **Monday:** Workshops and critiques for the previous weeks' project

- **Wednesday:** Introduction of a new concept, tool, programming language, etc.

- **Friday:** In-class exercises and work on your weekly project

_an idea: weekly awards or something based on their votes for each others' projects._
