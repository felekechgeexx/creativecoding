In this class you'll be completing several smaller projects throughout the semester -- about one per week -- and then you'll select and revise your best work to include in a final portfolio.

## Project: Remix
For this first project, write some code that appropriates some text, transforms it in some way, and present the resulting output as poetry. You may use command-line tools, write a Python script, or some combination thereof.

I encourage you to use books from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) as your sources, and to experiment with [Python's random](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python) functions, [text parsing with TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/), and poetic formats.

### Criteria


### Example: Frankenpoem

View, run, or modify as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/zachwhalen/creativecoding/blob/master/examples/Franken%20Poetry.ipynb) or a [Python 3 Script](https://github.com/zachwhalen/creativecoding/blob/master/examples/frankenpoetry.py).

Sample output:

<blockquote><pre>placid skiff
considerable youth

new month
prosperous society

mutable misery
good reality

only map
guilty night
</pre></blockquote>

## Project: Bot
Make a bot for Twitter or Mastadon. It can be text or image-based, but it should be meaningful in some way. I suggest using Cheap Bots Done Quick, but might also want to consider [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) or a hosted bot with [Glitch.com](http://www.glitch.com), bearing in mind that Twitter's API constraints may make this route untenable.

If you want your bot to live in Mastadon, I recommend the [botsin.space](http://botsin.space) instance.

### Criteria

### Example: Bots with CBDQ

The Twitter account, [@RRAAAAARRL](http://www.twitter.com/RRAAAAARRL), is a bot that tries to sound like [monsters from old comic books](http://comicbookplus.com/?dlid=12518). I made it in CBDQ, so you can [view the source there](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/RRAAAAARRL), or if you prefer, [as a JSON file](https://github.com/zachwhalen/creativecoding/blob/master/examples/rraaaaarrl.json). There's not much to it.

[@HouseBudgets](http://www.twitter.com/housebudgets) is also a [CBDQ bot](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/HouseBudgets), with some more complicated things going on [in the code](https://github.com/zachwhalen/creativecoding/blob/master/examples/housebudgets.json).
