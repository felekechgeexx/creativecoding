In this class you'll be completing several smaller projects throughout the semester -- about one per week -- and then you'll select and revise your best work to include in a final portfolio.

## Project: Remix
For this first project, write some code that appropriates some text, transforms it in some way, and present the resulting output as poetry. You may use command-line tools, write a Python script, or some combination thereof.

I encourage you to use books from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) as your sources, and to experiment with [Python's random](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python) functions, [text parsing with TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/), and poetic formats.

**Example: Frankenpoem**

View, run, or modify as a [Jupyter Notebook](/examples/Remix&20Poetry.ipynb) or a [Python 3 Script](/examples/remix-poetry.py).

Sample output:

<pre>placid skiff
considerable youth
new month
prosperous society
mutable misery
good reality
only map
guilty night
</pre>
